== Why the name?

`acm` is my login user, I have certain attachment to it.

== Who are you?

I'm a Software Engineer located in Europe. I've worked as backend in several companies. I also have plenty of experience with infrastructure. In my free time I work on my side projects as full stack, which I really enjoy. Finally, I love climbing.

== Why are you writing this blog?

.I have several reasons to start blogging:
* I have received a lot from the community and want to give back.
* I solve many problems that I find several times, I want a single place to group them together and be able to remember in the future.
* I find it easy to describe a problem orally, I struggle a bit writing as it consumes more of my time.
* I wanted a platform to share what I haven't been able to find in the Internet and I want to have my own rules.
